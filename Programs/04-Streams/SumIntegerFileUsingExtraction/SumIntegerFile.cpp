 * File: SumIntegerFile.cpp
 * ------------------------
 * This program calculates and prints the sum of the integers in
 * a data file chosen by the user.  This version of the program
 * makes no attempt to check that the file is formatted correctly
 * and is therefore not appropriate for use in practice.  It does,
 * however, illustrate the use of the extraction operator with files.
